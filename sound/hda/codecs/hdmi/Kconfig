	help
	  Say Y to enable HD-Audio Keep Alive (KAE) aka Silent Stream
	  for HDMI on hardware that supports the feature.

	  When enabled, the HDMI/DisplayPort codec will continue to provide
	  a continuous clock and a valid but silent data stream to
	  any connected external receiver. This allows to avoid gaps
	  at start of playback. Many receivers require multiple seconds
	  to start playing audio after the clock has been stopped.
	  This feature can impact power consumption as resources
	  are kept reserved both at transmitter and receiver.
